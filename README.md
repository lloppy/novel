## Project idea

Nowadays, information technology is becoming more and more popular. People interested in this technical field are offered such an abundance of different professions that at first it may scare them away. Hundreds of languages, libraries, dozens of frameworks, what to choose? So our team decided to make it a little easier for the future applicant by telling about one direction - game dev. This direction is the most demanded, according to the survey, among the students of the tenth - eleventh grades.
